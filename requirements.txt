Problem
Calculate rate for 2nd lowest cost  plan for a group of ZIP codes.

Task
check the csv files under resources

The output should be in stored in csv and display in stdout.  The first row should be the column headers: zipcode,rate
The remaining lines should output unquoted values with two digits after the decimal place of the rates, for example: 64148,245.20.

It may not be possible to determine a rate for every ZIP code given; for example, if there is only one silver plan available, there is no second lowest cost plan.
For example, 40813,.

Important points to consider -

1. It's used to compute the tax credit that qualifying individuals and families receive on the marketplace.
If your area offers multiple rates , pick the second lowest rate.
For example, if a rate area had silver plans with rates of [197.3, 197.3, 201.1, 305.4, 306.7, 411.24], the rate area would be 201.1, since it's the second lowest rate in that rate area.

2. A plan has a "metal level", which can be either Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Catastrophic.
The metal level is indicative of the level of coverage the plan provides.

3. A plan has a "rate", which is the amount that a consumer pays as a monthly premium, in dollars.

4. A plan has a "rate area", which is a geographic region in a state that determines the plan's rate.
A rate area is a tuple of a state and a number, for example, NY 1, IL 14.

5. There are two additional CSV files in this directory besides slcsp(sample).csv:

    plans(sample).csv — all the health plans in the U.S. on the marketplace
    zips(sample).csv — a mapping of ZIP code to county/counties & rate area(s)

6. ZIP code can potentially be in more than one county. If the county can not be determined definitively by the ZIP code,
it may still be possible to determine the rate area for that ZIP code. A ZIP code can also be in more than one rate area.
In that case, the answer is ambiguous and should be left blank.
